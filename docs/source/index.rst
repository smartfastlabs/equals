equals
=======


**equals** allows you to assert certain equality constraints between python
objects during testing. There are times where we don't want to assert
absolute equality, e.g. we need to ensure two lists have the same
elements, but don't care about order.  This was designed specifically for
usage with `Mock <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mock>`_ and `dobles <https://github.com/smartfastlabs/dobles>`_.
